  <history>Layer was received as a feature class within a file geodatabase via email directly from UNOCHA. It was then analyzed by ITOS for errors. Those errors were corrected and then the layer was sent back to UNOCHA as a feature class within a file geodatabase using the ITOS schema. The following errors were found and fixed by ITOS: 1. IMO has instructed ITOS to change the English name of Admin2 "Waraq" with p-code "EG2116" to "Auseem". This Admin2 name attribution was also changed in the Admin3 units belonging to Auseem 2. Admin2 names '10 Ramadan 1' and '10 Ramadan 2' were flipped in relation to each other across the Admin2 and Admin3 layers. IMO instructed ITOS that the Admin2 orientation was correct, therefore the Admin3 records were corrected to be consistent with Admin2. The Arabic name for "10 Ramadan 1" was changed to "قسم اول مدينة العاشر من رمضان 3. Reference name field added and populated. 4. In the Admin3 layer, the unit with pcode EG310212 was attributed as belonging to the 'Qusir' Admin2 unit but physically lied within the 'Safaga' Admin2 unit. It had its Admin2 attribution changed to "Safaga". Its admin3 p-code was changed to "EG310312" to have a correct admin 2 portion. 5. Geometry was edited in several places to match geometry of the Admin2 and Admin1 layers. 6. Leading spaces have been removed from Admin1 Arabic names The following issues were discovered by ITOS but were left as is in this candidate: 1. There are no English Admin3 name values (only Arabic). 2. Admin3 "بحيرة ناصر" with p-code "EG280217" has geometry that does not exist in Admin0-2.</history>
